# TabSaver

Every student knows the experience of having multiple projects due soon. Multiple windows of research on different topics means that one winds up almost always opening the wrong window, which is a really big hassle at times, not to mention the performance dip that comes as a result of having so many tabs open at once.

This extension saves the current window (using the in-extension UI) under a name that can be accessed later (as set by the user) even after the computer is shut off, so the tabs can be closed and productivity saved.
